Bookmarklet
According to wikipedia, a bookmarklet is a piece of code that can be used as a bookmark to add new browser features. Follow the link and it'll send you to a page with bookmarklet to copy. Tried using Visual Studio Code but no luck but you can clearly see that the flag is encoded. Created a new bookmark and pasted the code into the URL. Open that "URL" and it popped a text box with the flag.

You can shift through the home, about, and contact page. However, the about page says you might find the flag if youn inspect that one. Inspect the element and you'll see the HTML section right before <h1> header stating to inspect the flag. The second has an odd string that 'notify_true=". It looks base64 and you can ask ChatGPT to confirm.

Use the website and decode. It's only encoded by base64 once. Important to note for later I'm sure as other base64's may be encoded multiple times.
